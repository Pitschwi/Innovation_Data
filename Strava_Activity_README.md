Heading: Strava Activities Analysis Project

This is a project that was inspired by my activities in Strava and an opportunity to clean and transform data and then use Tableau to showcase my data visualization skills.

Strava is a popular app used by runners, cyclists and enthusiasts of other sports to track activities with a built in GPS to track location, speed and distance where appropriate.
The app allows users to analyze the activities after they are uploaded from a watch, other device or entered manually and connect with other users as other users can like and comment on the activities. Here is a link to the site: https://www.strava.com/

Before creating the project, I had three questions that I wanted answers and this drove the decision for charts and choice of dimensions and measures. My three questions were: When is the Best Time of Day to Exercise the fastest? What activities did I perform the most and Does my Cadence change during the year while running? The best time of day most often included data from running, walking and cycling as those were activities with speed.

During the data cleaning process, I realized that I needed to transform the data to create an activity time that included morning, afternoon and evening. The transformation included converting almost 800 data points with string data into morning, afternoon or evening based on the time stamp of when the activity occurred. Originally, I downloaded all of the data from July 2019 to April 2025 but decided on the 800 as it was a large enough sample size.

Tools used included Excel and Tableau.

Charts used: Bar and Line Charts to have findings stand out in bar chart and see changes over time with the line chart.

Key Findings:
Morning is the best time to perform an activity followed by afternoon.

Running was the activity that I performed the most followed by Walking and then Cycling.

Cadence does change over time with the highest cadence occuring in October and March a close second. I also learned that distance also increased in the month of March. The data makes sense as March is a major training month when preparing for an April Half Marthon race. October is a popular month for races including Half and Full Marathons so the mileage and cadence increases in October also makes sense.
