Headings:Pay Equity Excel Project

This is a small guided project from AIHR that answers questions that an HR Department has about Pay Equity

This is a pay equity guided project where the HR department was interested in analyzing salary bands, pay for top performers and demographics of each of the major departments. The source is AIHR and a YouTube video walking through a project that produces Excel Charts.

Excel was used to conduct the analysis and fake data was used for confidentiality. Bar Charts were used to clearly show the average salaries of performers in different salary bands and markers were used in a distrbuition of employee age to show the current demographics of the workforce. Excel tables and a card with Average Salary and Age were also included. 

Slicers were included to allow more functionality and for the HR department to view differences for regions, gender, manager and department.

Key findings included that the company should consider increasing pay for females in both managerial and non-managerial roles as there was over a $11,000 pay gap when gender is analyzed. Additionally, top performers were the highest paid associates in each salary band and this meets the target for the organization and no changes are recommended.
